# Contributing to The SHAPE Methodology

Thank you for your interest in contributing to The SHAPE Methodology.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

- Open an issue describing what's unclear, incorrect, or could be improved
- Include specific sections or page references where applicable

### Suggesting Improvements

- Fork the repository
- Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b improvement/description`)
- Make your changes
- Submit a pull request with a clear description of what you changed and why

### What We're Looking For

- **Real-world case studies** — Have you applied SHAPE in your organization? Share what happened.
- **Worksheet improvements** — Better templates, additional exercises, clearer instructions
- **Translations** — Help make the methodology accessible in other languages
- **Corrections** — Typos, broken links, unclear language
- **Takers/Shapers/Makers examples** — Additional examples of each approach in practice

### What Doesn't Fit

- Tool-specific recommendations (the methodology is deliberately tool-agnostic)
- Promotional content for specific vendors or platforms
- Changes that fundamentally alter the five phases (Situation, Hypothesis, Action, Process, Evaluation)
